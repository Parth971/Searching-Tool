It will run for 4 years and is open to all public sector, non-residential premises in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. For example: schools, NHS trusts and local authorities. Businesses, charities or public sector organisations currently served by a water supplier based in Wales are only eligible to switch water retailers if they use more than 50 million litres of water a year. Otherwise they will continue to be served by their regional water company. If your business premises are in Wales and your usage is above the 50 million litre threshold, you can choose to remain with your current retailer or switch. You can contract with a supplier at any time during the agreement, and run a contract for up to a maximum of 4 years from when supply starts. Buyers can run a mini-tender or join a   CCS quarterly aggregation.  As of 1 April 2017 eligible, non-household customers (those that pay business rates) can choose their water supplier. Ofwat has published full  eligibility guidance  and  supplementary guidance . Benefits",

These services could include: \n workforce planning advice, which includes assessing recruitment gaps and ensuring your organisation has the right people with the right skills \n permanent recruitment \n organised talent pools, which will allow you to find and select individuals based on certain criteria  \n ways to attract applicants to apply for positions such as: \n \n client branding, which will help you to build an online presence to show potential workers why they should work for your organisation through videos, blogs and articles \n employee value proposition (EVP) development: which includes the benefits that the worker will receive in return for their work, such as pay, learning and development opportunities and the culture of the organisation \n \n \n We have not made any decisions yet about the structure of this agreement.

    "description": "This is the next iteration of network services and will replace the current  Network Services 2 agreement.  Our aim for this agreement is to design a route to market that provides for a wide range of customers including those who need: \n flexible “user-based’ communication solutions such as integrated voice, data and video connectivity through a single network connection, providing an encrypted VPN connection to the gateway provider \n \n traditional network infrastructure solutions such as buying multiple network circuits based on resilience, security and specific business connectivity needs \n Services which will be available through this agreement include: \n core network infrastructure, including services and equipment needed for network access \n local area network including products and services facilitating connectivity within the customers location \n fibre optic cabling \n 5G network \n internet access \n unified communications: application or platform that provides multiple communication methods including voice, video and data services \n IoT (Internet of Things) \n Smart Technologies (Smart, shared and connected spaces) \n Internet Protocol (IP) Telephony enables voice calls over the internet \n cloud services \n audio and video conferencing (collaboration services) \n radio services \n satellite networking \n maintenance and support services \n critical domain services: the services needed to register, maintain and manage domain names \n contact centre services \n security and surveillance \n Our plan is to provide you with the products and services to help customers and suppliers to develop fully integrated solutions to meet your communication needs. This means you will be able to buy managed solutions from a supplier as well as component parts as you consider the changing network needs within the modern hybrid workspace. This will enable the workforce to access all applications and data at home and from the office. We trust that this will also challenge suppliers to propose commercial models that provide a higher level of flexibility and value for money, whilst minimising the risk of connectivity outages and meeting security needs. We intend for this agreement to run for 3 years with the option to extend for a further year. Benefits",
